## Tools used

[Shadcn (Tailwind + Radix base for a components library)](https://ui.shadcn.com) (That's why components in the "ui" folder are named in lowercase, when we install components of the library they are auto-generated and named like that, otherwise I would have named the files and functions names differently)
